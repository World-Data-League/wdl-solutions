    "This notebook is one of the mandatory deliverables when you submit your solution. Its structure follows the WDL evaluation criteria and it has dedicated cells where you should add information. Make sure your code is readable as it will be the only technical support the jury will have to evaluate your work. Make sure to list all the datasets used besides the ones provided.\n",

    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. 🧱 Create a separate copy of this template and **do not change** the predefined structure\n",
    "2. 👥 Fill in the Authors section with the name of each team member\n",
    "3. 💻 Develop your code - make sure to add comments and save all the output you want the jury to see. Your code **must be** runnable!\n",
    "4. 📄 Fill in all the text sections\n",
    "5. 🗑️ Remove this section (‘Notebook Submission Template’) and any instructions inside other sections\n",
    "6. 📥 Export as HTML and make sure all the visualisations are visible.\n",
    "7. ⬆️ Upload the .ipynb file to the submission platform.\n"
