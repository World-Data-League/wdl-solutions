Clicking the link above should load a JupyterLab environment running in your browser. Open the Introductory notebook at `content/Intro.ipynb` to get started.

## About this repository

This is a demonstration repository meant for use at `try.jupyter.org`. It uses the [JupyterLite project](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to embed a self-contained Jupyter environment in the browser, along with many popular packages in scientific computing.

It uses GitHub pages to serve the JupyterLite bundle, and is accessible at https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter.

### How to edit these notebooks

The notebooks in this repository are written with [JupyterLite kernels](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels/index.html), so if you edit them locally, you will likely over-write the kernel information with your local kernels.
As such, the easiest way to make edits to them is to do so [**via the Try Jupyter Page**](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter).
Make the edits you wish at that URL, then download the notebook and replace the one in a repository locally.
