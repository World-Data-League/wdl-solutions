## Challenge: Avencas Marine Protected Area: Predict the future of the local ecosystem and its species
Changes in oceanic environments present a substantial threat to marine life, affecting nearly 1000 species of marine animals, ranging from sea turtles and sharks to small fish and plankton. Moreover, the risk of extinction for marine mammals is alarmingly high, with approximately 37% of all marine mammal species facing this threat.

Understanding the influence of environmental variables on biodiversity and species abundance is of utmost importance.

The objective of this challenge is to develop a scalable predictive model that offers valuable insights into the future developments of endangered and invasive species in the Avencas Marine Protected Area. The proposed solutions should account for species' developments during the observation period and ideally be easily adaptable for application in other marine ecosystems with similar data.
