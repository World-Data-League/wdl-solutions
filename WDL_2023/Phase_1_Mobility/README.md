## Challenge: Determining The Main Mobility Flows in the City of Lisbon Based on Mobile Device Data
Over the last 40 years, 300,000 individuals have moved from the City of Lisbon to its outskirts in the metropolitan area. During the same time period, public transport journeys within the city dropped from 46% to 22% in 2017.

With public transport usage decreasing and car usage increasing, it's crucial to analyze the main mobility flows and understand commuting patterns in order to promote more sustainable modes of transport. For this purpose, the city of Lisbon acquired a large dataset of anonymized mobile device movement data.

The intended outcome of this challenge is to achieve a better understanding and visualization of how people move between city grids during rush hours. Teams are expected to present a model that can predict those movements and identify potential interventions to improve the commuting experience of people in Lisbon and promote sustainable modes of mobility.
