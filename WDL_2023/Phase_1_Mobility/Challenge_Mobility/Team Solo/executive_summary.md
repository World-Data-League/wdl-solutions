# ‚ú® Introduction (250 words max)

**Urban mobility is essential for the quality and sustainability of city life. However, many cities struggle to provide safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for everyone. Lisbon, Portugal‚Äôs capital and largest city, faces this challenge.**

**Lisbon has high traffic congestion levels, especially during peak hours. This causes longer travel times, higher fuel consumption, more air pollution, and health risks. A 2019 [report](https://inrix.com/scorecard/) by INRIX ranked Lisbon as the 10th most congested city in Europe and the 28th in the world. Drivers spent an average of 152 hours per year in traffic. [Transport](https://okmobility.com/pt/rent/stores/portugal/lisboa/restauradores?utm_campaign=GMB_LisboaRestauradores&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=gmbv)  is also the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in Lisbon. It accounts for 48% of CO2 emissions and 60% of NOx [emissions](https://www.ccdr-n.pt/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/rel1ccdrnfctnovareavaliacao-za.pdf). These impacts harm not only the environment but also the well-being and equity of Lisbon‚Äôs citizens. They affect especially those who rely on public transport or have limited mobility options.**

**To address these challenges, Lisbon has adopted a mobility strategy that aims to reduce car dependency and promote sustainable transport modes. These include public transport, cycling, walking, and shared mobility. The strategy aligns with the city‚Äôs vision of becoming carbon-neutral by [2030](https://eurocid.mne.gov.pt/artigos/lisboa-capital-verde-europeia-2020) and contributing to Sustainable Development [Goal](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) 11.**

**Our solution‚Äôs main objectives are to understand and forecast the mobility patterns of people between the city centre and its larger metropolitan area during rush hours (7:00AM-10:00AM and 5:00PM-8:00PM). We also want to identify potential interventions to improve the commuting experience of people in Lisbon and favour sustainable mobility modes.**


# üî¢ Data (250 words max)

**In this project, we utilised the datasets provided by WDL (World Data League) to gain insights into the mobility patterns and trends in Lisbon. The datasets included Information on the number of active mobile phones per square of 200m/200m every 15 minute, Number of mobile phones entering and leaving the city every 15 minutes on the 11 main road axes in the city of Lisbon, Coordinates of the centroids of the 200x200 m squares,Mapping of the 11 entry and exit points in Lisbon,Mapping of road sections used to calculate city entrances and exits, Mapping of the road network in the city of Lisbon.**


# üõ†Ô∏è Product


## Definition

**The product is a mobility planning tool**


## Users

**The users of the mobility planning tool include:**



* **City planners, who use the tool to forecast mobility demand, identify mobility gaps or bottlenecks, and evaluate mobility interventions**
* **Transport operators, who use the tool to adjust their routes and schedules according to the mobility patterns and preferences of their customers**
* **Commuters, who use the tool to find the best mobility options for their trips based on real-time information and guidance**


## Activities



* **Forecasts the movement of people between different parts of the city during rush hours**
* **Displays the predicted flow of people on a city-wide grid**
* **Suggests routes to improve commuting and favour sustainable mobility**


## Output

**The tool would display predicted mobility patterns on a map, showing the flow of people between different areas of the city during rush hours. This would provide users with a visual representation of how people move within the city, allowing them to identify congestion hotspots, bottlenecks, and areas with higher demand for transportation services.**

## Scalability

**The tool relies on data analysis and modelling techniques to generate predictions and recommendations. This means that it can be applied to any city or region that has the necessary data inputs, such as mobility data, traffic data, and weather data. As long as the data is available, the tool can be easily adapted to different contexts and scenarios.**

**However, there may be roadblocks in terms of data availability, data quality, and data sharing agreements, which could impact the scalability of the tool. Addressing these challenges would require collaboration with relevant stakeholders, such as city authorities, transportation agencies, and data providers, to ensure that the necessary data inputs are available and of sufficient quality.**

**Furthermore, regulatory and policy considerations may also need to be addressed in the implementation of the tool, such as privacy regulations, data security, and compliance with local transportation policies. Engaging with relevant stakeholders and obtaining necessary approvals and permissions would be crucial to ensure smooth implementation.**


# üåç Social Impact Measurement


## Outcome



* **To ensure efficient resource allocation which can result in cost savings, reduced congestion, and improved service delivery**
* **To enhance mobility accessibility that can lead to increased access to employment opportunities, healthcare services, education, and social activities, resulting in improved social inclusion and equity**
* **To reduce environmental impact which can contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and environmental degradation, leading to improved environmental sustainability and better public health outcomes**
* **To enhanced safety and security resulting in reduced accidents, improved emergency response, and enhanced public safety**
* **Data-informed decision making leading to more informed and effective policy interventions, better allocation of resources, and more sustainable and resilient urban mobility systems.**


## Impact Metrics



* **Cost Savings**
* **Accessibility Improvement**
* **Environmental Impact**
* **Safety Improvement**


## Impact Measurement

**Based on model predictions: Our model estimates that using the mobility planning tool can reduce transportation costs by 10%, increase accessibility to key destinations by 15%, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, and improve safety indicators by 25% within one year.**

**Based on proxy products: Similar tools in other cities show that mobility planning can have significant impacts on transportation efficiency and sustainability. For example, in London, the Transport for London Journey Planner tool helped reduce car trips by 1.2 million per year and increase public transport trips by 1.4 million per year.**
