## Challenge: Energy communities inclusive of residents vulnerable to energy poverty
Energy communities have emerged as a powerful tool for allocating and distributing energy in an equitable manner. Recognizing their significance, the European Union has recently introduced the [Energy Communities Repository](https://energy-communities-repository.ec.europa.eu/index_en), which categorizes various types of energy communities that prioritize social and environmental benefits over financial profits.

The intended outcome of this challenge is to develop an optimization algorithm that proposes potential energy communities in the city of Ghent. The algorithm should consider factors such as renewable energy production sites, energy consumption patterns, and the inclusion of residents vulnerable to energy poverty. Furthermore, the algorithm should be designed to be scalable, enabling its application in other cities with similar data collection.
